# Feels Gap Investigation

## Tool: Tableau
## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/data

## Description:
This repository is for the data visualization project on investigating the reason why there's a difference between the actual temperature and how human perceives it with dataset found in Kaggle.

The dataset provides daily weather information for capital cities all around the world. Unlike forecast data, this dataset actually offers a more comprehensive set of features that show the current weather conditions around the world. The data is collected starting from August 2023 till the current date. 

## Summary:
Our project began with a simple curiosity: why does it sometimes feel much hotter or colder than the actual temperature? Through visualization and analysis, we have found out that there are 3 main factors that affect how we perceive temperature: humidity, wind speed and UV index.  
Human bodyâ€™s ability to cool itself through sweat evaporation is reduced due to high humidity, especially in tropical climates, making it feel hotter. However, high humidity in colder or drier regions may create a chilling effect. Wind speed consistently gives a cooling effect, lowering the temperature perception. While UV index is generally associated with heat but showed different results which could be due to its interaction with cloud coverage, elevation or time of day. 
To summarize, there is no one single factor that affects how we perceive temperature and 
explains the feels gap, but rather a combination that is influenced by geography.
